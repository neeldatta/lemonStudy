# lemonStudy

Case study on LemonSlice's video ai. trying to identify potential improvements to their UIUX as well as learn how diffusion works.

UIUX Changes:

Current Flow: Landing → Get Started → Unknown (what does the user do next? View use cases? Try a demo? Join the discord?)

1. Improved User Flow Implementation:

- Landing / [Try Live Chat] → Learn More/ Create Account → Move to third party app.etc? and get one free token (Then - Upgrade)

2. Interactive AI Video Chat as Hero

- Immediate engagement: First thing users see is a live, interactive chat demo
- Functional simulation: Users can type messages and see the AI character respond
- Visual feedback: Character animations and status indicators create immersion

3. Dynamic Headline System

- Rotates through: "Interactive" → "Personalized" → "Conversational" → "Responsive" → "Alive"
- Reinforces the core value props while keeping the page fresh and engaging

4. Clear CTA (Call to Action) Hierarchy

- Primary: "Start Live Chat" (impossible to miss, prominent placement)
- Secondary: "View Use Cases", "View Gallery", "Enter Contests"
- Conversion: User is now intrigued to create their own, leading to them signing up/paying for premium

5. Founder's Vision Distilled

- Vision Section: Perfectly captures the Netflix/interactive future concept
- Concise messaging: "Imagine opening Netflix and describing the exact show you want to watch..."
- Compelling narrative: Positions live chat as "the first step toward this interactive future"

6. Enhanced Visual Design

- Dark, premium aesthetic: More sophisticated than typical SaaS landing pages
- Golden accent color: Premium feel that matches the innovative nature
- Breathing animations: AI character feels alive and responsive

Diffusion/Live Chat:

- trying to learn how to do this myself lol
